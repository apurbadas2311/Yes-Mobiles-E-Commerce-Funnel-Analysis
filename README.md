# Yes-Mobiles-E-Commerce-Funnel-Analysis

A Data-Driven Analysis to Optimize the Mobile Purchase Funnel
This repository documents the complete 
User Funnel Analysis conducted for Apurba Yes Mobiles. The project aims to track user behavior through the four-stage mobile purchasing funnel: 
BROWSING, ADDED WISHLIST, ADDED CART, and PURCHASED.
The analysis segments user activity by Gender to identify where the largest drop-offs occur and how different demographics interact with the site, using conversion rates and average time spent as key performance indicators. The findings provide critical insights for marketing and UX teams to improve targeting, streamline the checkout process, and ultimately increase mobile sales.

üíª Example Usage Scenario
A digital marketing specialist reviews the findings to optimize ad spend:
1.	They note that Males take longer (6.34 days Avg Time Spent) than females.
2.	They note that Females convert better (30.00% Conversion Rate).
3.	Action: The specialist decides to allocate a larger portion of the budget to acquisition campaigns targeting the female demographic, while setting up a retargeting campaign for males who linger in the funnel to push them toward the final purchase.
